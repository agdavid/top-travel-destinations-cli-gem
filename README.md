# TopTravelDestinations

Welcome to the Top Travel Destinations CLI gem! This gem was inspired by a love for traveling the world and learning about new cultures and experiences. The gem uses information from the TripAdvisor Travelers' Choice Destinations website (http://www.tripadvisor.com/TravelersChoice-Destinations) to provide you with easy-access to two levels of information: (1) the regions of the world; and (2) the top destinations of that region, as provided by TripAdvisor.  The world is your oyster. Safe travels and thank you for using the Top Travel Destinations CLI gem.  

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'top_travel_destinations'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install top_travel_destinations

## Usage

The Top Travel Destinations CLI gem has simple instructions:
1) At the "Here are the Regions of the World" prompt, enter an alphanumeric number (i.e., 1-9) to select a region.
2) The gem will automatically generate the Top Destinations for that region.
3) After viewing Top Destinations for one region, either enter:
    (a)'list' to return to the list of regions;
    (b) 'exit' to leave the gem.

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. Then, run `rake spec` to run the tests. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
