# TopTravelDestinations
Welcome to the Top Travel Destinations CLI gem! This gem was inspired by a love for traveling the world and learning about new cultures and experiences. The gem uses information from the [TripAdvisor Travelers' Choice Destinations website](http://www.tripadvisor.com/TravelersChoice-Destinations) to provide you with easy-access to three levels of information:

1. the regions of the world
2. the top destinations of that region
3. a description of each top destination, as provided by TripAdvisor.  

The world is your oyster. Safe travels and thank you for using the Top Travel Destinations CLI gem.
